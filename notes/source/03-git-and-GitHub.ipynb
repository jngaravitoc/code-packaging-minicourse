    "All code should be under version control to keep track of changes over time and when it comes to version control ``git`` is the dominant system. A 2018 Stack Overflow survey of developers' version control use found that [90% of developers use git](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#work-_-version-control), with the second most popular version control being the older [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/), likely mostly to use legacy code that still lives in Subversion repositories. ``git`` is most widely supported by code hosting services, with [GitHub](https://github.com/) only hosting ``git`` repositories and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) [dropping support](https://bitbucket.org/blog/sunsetting-mercurial-support-in-bitbucket) for the main ``git`` alternative ``mercurial`` in 2020. Basically, ``git`` is now the only game in town."

    "## Version control\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is a system for tracking and making changes to code as the code develops. Version control stores code in a \"repository\" and when using version control, any changes to the code are logged through a code \"commit\" that lists the files changed and provides a brief description of the changes; version control software then generates a \"diff\" with respect to the previous version that gets stored, such that the full history of changes is available for use in the future. Opinions differ on how many changes to include in a single commit (which can consist of changes to multiple files at once), but typically it is best to keep commits as \"atomic\" as possible, that is, create a commit at the smallest change that is reasonable to call a change or improvement to the code. Commits are often as small as changing a single line, perhaps improving the documentation or fixing a small bug. When making changes to existing code, it is always best to keep commits at the level of small changes, so any issues with the changes can later easily be pinned down to a specific change; change commits should typically consist of a few lines to a few dozen lines of edited code at most. When first implementing a new feature, it may make sense to wait to commit until a draft version of the feature is working and one can thus end up with a larger commit, but even then it is best to first implement as bare a skeleton of the new feature as possible and then edit it with small changes until the feature is fully implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early version control systems kept the history of changes stored in a central location while each developer only had a copy of the current version of the code; thus, every code commit and every query of the code's history required interaction with the central location (often remote, requiring an internet connection). Because this meant that one could not commit while offline and even when online was an impediment to quick progress due to the sometimes slow response time of the central location, this led to often bloated commits. One of the great improvements in ``git`` is that each copy of the code's repository contains the full history, leading to a decentralized system where there is no need for a central location. Different copies of a ``git`` repositories are called \"clones\" and with ``git``, clones can communicate among themselves without needing to go through a central place. Of course, the current reality is that most ``git`` repositories have \"main\" copies that are stored in online services like GitHub or Bitbucket, with most of the communication between different clones happening through the main hosted copy of the code. Nevertheless, the fact that each clone contains the entire history means that you can easily commit code and investigate the history without requiring interaction with a centralized repository, and this is therefore much faster and robust against network interruptions.\n",

    "## Basic ``git`` use\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic cycle of ``git`` use is a cycle of ``git pull``, ``git commit``, ``git push``. These commands, respectively, pull in the latest changes from the remote main version of the code repository (e.g., hosted on GitHub), commit new changes made to the code, and push the changes in this commit(s) back to the remote main version. If you add ``git diff`` for looking at the not-yet-committed current set of changes, ``git status`` for interrogating the status of the repository and ``git log`` for looking at the history of the code, and you have well over 95% of my typical usage of ``git``.\n",

    "git commit\n",
    "```\n",
    "will open a text editor (set by your ``git`` defaults) that allows you to write a message describing the change; this will perform a single commit for *all* current changes to *all* changed files in the repository. You can avoid the use of the text editor by directly specifying the message as\n",
    "```\n",
    "git commit -m \"A message describing the atomic change made\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "which I personally prefer as a fan of the command line (and of speed!). You can list specific files to only commit changes to those files by adding them to the command as\n",
    "```\n",
    "git commit -m \"A message describing the atomic change made\" file1.py file2.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is good practice to *always specify the files you are committing changes for* rather than not specifying any files or specifying a folder (which would commit changes to all files in that folder). This way, you don't end up accidentally committing changes made to other files that are unrelated to the current commit (we will see [below](#Some-useful-advanced-git-features) how you can even split up changes in a single files into different commits).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can start committing changes to files, you need to tell ``git`` about the existence of the file in the first place (typically soon after you create the file, in preparation for your first commit of the file). This is done using ``git add`` which you call with\n",
    "```\n",
    "git add file1.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "and you can also list multiple files. Even though you specify a directory and you can use wildcards, it is again good practice to always explicitly list all files that you are adding, rather than an entire folder or more, because that way you will invariably end up adding files that you did not want to add and removing them again can be difficult.\n",

When you have cloned the code from GitHub and are working in the master branch, a simple\n",

    "## Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "A feature of most version control systems and one that is especially easy to use with ``git`` is the ability to *branch* off the main development branch of your code to focus on developing a single feature, fix a single bug, etc. After you are satisfied with the changes on the branch, these changes are *merged* back into the main development commit history. A crucial part of the implementation of the ``git`` software is fast and intelligent algorithms to perform such merges automatically, even when the difference between the feature branch and the main branch are substantial. When ``git`` is unable to automatically merge branches, the repository goes into a suspended state until the user manually resolves any merges that cannot be automatically done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches are an incredibly useful feature of ``git``, especially when combined with ``forks`` discussed [below](#Using-GitHub-to-build-a-community-for-your-code), and you should make liberal use of them. Branches allow you to split off things like implementing new features, while still keeping the ability to fix bugs in the main branch without that fix having to wait for the new feature to be ready to go \"live\". Branches also allow you to develop new features in the incremental way that you should implement all of your code (with many commits), without necessarily having to worry at first that the new feature is entirely compatible with the existing code or that it passes all existing tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main branch is called ``master``. It is good practice to keep this branch as clean as possible, that is, avoid having it be in a state where it contains partially implemented features or bug fixes.
