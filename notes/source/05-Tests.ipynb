    "Thoroughly testing your code is crucial for allowing others (and yourself!) use it confidently, for maintaining your code long-term, and for developing new features. Testing your code needs to be done *continuously*, that is, it is not long-term useful to perform a test of the impementation of new feature or of its integration with the rest of your package if you do not save the test and re-run it every time the code changes; unfortunately, this still remains the main mode in which scientific software is tested. Instead you need to write a comprehensive **test suite** that checks that your code keeps working the way you intend it to work as your package grows and evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a comprehensive test suite is essential for being as confident as you can be that your code is correct (of course, no test suite is 100% water tight). But having a comprehensive test suite also helps you maintain and develop your package. A test suite makes maintenance easier, because you can catch new problems early (e.g., an issue stemming from a change in a dependency), when they are typically easier to solve. It is also easy to check that your package works with a new minor (or major, but that will likely be a while) versio of Python itself. It also helps you in developing your code, especially in allowing large-scale changes to the underlying framework of your package without changing the package's user interface (or without changing it much). For example, if you want to completely re-vamp the way a complex sub-module of your code with many functions and classes is implemented, this is difficult to do without a comprehensive test suite, because it would be difficult to be sure that no user-facing functionality changed. But with a good test suite, you can be sure that your underlying changes do not break code that people have using your package or the way they interact with your code. Having a comprehensive test suite is also absolutely essential if you will be accepting pull requests (which you should!) from outside users: without a test suite, it would be very difficult to know that changes proposed in a pull request (especially if there are many) do not break some part of your code (you would be surprised at how easily even a small change in one part of your package can cause problems in unexpected places).\n",

    "Tests of a Python package are regular Python statements, function, etc., just like any other Python code. They become tests of your software package simply by virtue of *context*: tests are regular Python files with function, classes, etc. that live in a designated spot for tests of your package and that consist of a set of statements checking that your code works as intended. At some level, any use of your package by yourself and other users is a test of your code, because users will (or should) be sanity-checking your code's results and report issues of the results are incorrect or unexpected. But your package should contain a dedicated set of tests, which we will refer to as a *test suite*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first decision you have to make is where to put your tests. Tests should be part of the same ``git`` repository that contains the package itself and then there are essentially two options: (i) you can put the tests *outside of the package itself*, by putting them in a sub-directory of the top-level directory of your package's ``git`` repository, or (ii) you can incorporate the tests *into the package itself*, that is, include them as a sub-directory within your Python package's directory (or in a set of sub-directory, e.g., to separate tests by submodule). The latter option allows you to include the tests in distributions of your code, which may be useful to allow people who have installed your code to run the tests themselves and verify that they pass on their system. However, I believe it is better to choose option (i) and keep the tests outside of the package itself. This is for a few reasons: (a) packages should be as light-weight as possible and a comprehensive test suite will be large (e.g., for ``galpy``, the test suite currently contains about 30k lines, while the package itself has about 40k, excluding comments and docstrings), (b) your package should be as well documented and tested as possible, but you will likely not document the tests much and almost certainly not write a test suite for the tests (and so on!), (c) your tests may have difficult-to-install dependencies that you do not want users of your code to have to install, and (d) the main issues that users will run into are installation issues and when they can install and load your code, it's highly unlikely that a test of the code's functionality would fail, so there really isn't too much point in normal users of your code running the test suite themselves if you run it yourself often. Thus, you should include tests in a ``tests/`` sub-directory of your top-level directory, which therefore now looks like (for the ``exampy`` example package from [chapter 2](02-Package-Structure.ipynb#Package-layout)):\n",
    "```\n",
    "TOP-LEVEL_DIRECTORY/\n",
    "    docs/\n",
    "    exampy/\n",
    "    tests/\n",
    "    README.md\n",
    "    setup.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``tests/`` directory then contains s set of Python ``.py`` files that contain tests of your code. For a large software package, one option would be to mirror your package's structure of sub-modules and arrange tests in a similar directory tree under ``tests/``, but typically it's easy enough to simply include a bunch of ``*.py`` files in the ``tests/`` directory itself that test all of your packages functionality in all of its submodules. To seamlessly integrate with the ``pytest`` test framework, your tests should be arranged as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tests should be in filenames that start with ``test_`` and end in ``.py``, so for exampe, ``test_basic_math.py`` will contain tests of the basic math included in ``exampy``'s top-level module below\n",
    "\n",
    "* Functions that contain tests to be run within the test files should start with ``test``; if you use classes to arrange tests, these need to start with ``Test``. Your test files can include other functions or classes, for example as helper functions/classes for your tests, but these will not be executed as tests by ``pytest`` below.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will focus on the case of using functions to write tests, rather than classes. Using classes for tests is useful when your tests require common, expensive initialization procedures, which can easily be done with a ``TestX`` test class, but is difficult when using functions. When this is not necessary, it is easier to simply use functions that contain all of the setup for your test, such that they can stand alone and can be run independently from each other. This is useful when diagnosing problems with your tests or code.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a matter of taste how you arrange tests of different parts of your package into a set of test files. One option is to have a single file per package file that contains the tests of that package file's functionality, but that leaves it unclear where to put tests of the integration of different parts of your package. Another option is to use one file (or a few files, if a logical division can be made) for each submodule and then include tests of the interplay between different submodules in the most relevant submodule's test file(s). However you choose to arrange your tests, use a logical structure that makes it easy to find where tests are located for your future self and for other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going on to describe how to write Python tests, it is useful to consider what are *good* properties of tests of a scientific software package and how to construct a good test suite:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Many of your tests should be as minimal, short, and atomic as possible*: you should strive to make sure that each function in your package does what you intend it to do and that they do this correctly; this is called [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing). If your package is well written, it should consist mostly of relatively small units (functions, classes, etc.) that work together to do more complex things. Unit testing makes sure that the smallest units of code in your package work as intended, because having all of the parts of a complex code work is a pre-requisite to having the entire complex code work correctly. Testing these small units of your package should be possible with relatively brief tests: they should require as little setup as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Your test suite should include integration tests*: Besides making sure that the atomic parts of your code work correctly, you should test that they work together to create more complex workflows that work as expected. Even if all of the individual parts of your code work to your satisfaction, it can still easily be the case that their combination does not work as you intended (this can be as simple as their outputs and inputs not being compatible, or more complicated when, e.g., approximations that seem correct for parts of your code are not good enough for their combination with other parts of your code). These integration tests will typically be more complex pieces of Python code that more directly resemble actual use of your code, but that's okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Your tests should run in as little time as possible*: Having to wait for a long test-suite to run before knowing whether or not your code contains bugs or other errors will strongly impede your progress (I should know, ``galpy``'s test suite currently runs for close to an hour, even when spreading the tests over six machines!). Thus, you want your tests to run *fast*. Because a test suite for any decent-sized package will contain many individual test functions, each of the individual test funtions should run very fast in order for the entire test suite to run quickly.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Of course, for complex scientific software, it is inevitable that some tests will require a longer time to run (long in the context of tests starts at something like one second, and you should definitely avoid any test that requires more than a minute to run). You might want to check that your code works to a certain high level of precision and that level of precision requires a long computation. In such cases, it is useful to also include a shorter version of the same test if this is possible (for example, one that requires less time to get a lower precision result) that can be run before the longer version of the test, such that not-too-subtle bugs can be found using the shorter test without having to wait for the longer test to finish.\n",
    " \n",
    "* *You should test outputs of your code as well as the errors and warnings that it raises*: You want to focus your efforts on making sure that the values your code returns are correct, but if your code raises errors in certain cases or warnings, it is important to test whether these are raised appropriately as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You should test setting non-default values for your functions' keyword parameters*: For all functions with optional parameters, you should test that changing the value of any optional parameters is properly handled by the code (e.g., to make sure you haven't accidentally hard-coded the value of an optional parameter somewhere). If you have more than one optional parameter, it quickly becomes difficult to test all possible combinations of setting or not setting keywords, but there is little harm in combining these and simply using a test that changes the value of *all* keywords from their defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *You want to have at least one test for each function, but it's typically best to test many different invocations*: Even for simple functions, try multiple values of the input arguments and kewyords to more extensively test the function. If your funtion has conditional statements, this is likely necessary to obtain a high coverage, as we will discuss more below (because a single invocation only tests a single path through your code's conditional statements, thus not testing the other paths).\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Add a test for each reported issue whose fix required a code change*: When users report an issue with the code that requires you to change the code, add a test that checks that the issue was fixed. This will prevent the issue from arising again in the future, e.g., when you accidentally undo the fix later. Often the best way to start editing your code in response to a reported issue is to *first* write a test that fails because of the issue and then make the fix in the code; once the test passes you are ready to close the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *You should document your test suite*: Many tests of a scientific software package will be non-trivial (e.g., checking the code against the result of an analytical calculation). To make sure you remember what you were thinking when you wrote specific test, extensively document your reasoning with code comments. Users will not (typically) be importing and using your test suite, so there is no need for true docstrings, but keeping a basic level of documentation of all functions in your test suite will make it easier for you and other developers to understand, use, and extend it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from these general desirable properties of a good test suite, the structure of good tests for a scientific software package will depend strongly on the package itself. While including very simple test cases of general functions is useful for catching major issues (e.g., testing the ``exampy.integrate.riemann`` function with a constant function), be careful in only depending on the simplest possible tests, because it is likely that these would not catch more subtle issues with your code because they are *too* simple (i.e., even a slightly wrong version of your code might get them right enough). In my own field of astrophysics, we often have analytical solutions for certain inputs of computations that our code can perform in general and it is useful to test that such analytical solutions are correctly reproduced (and it is good to test against non-trvial analytical solutions if they exist). If a computational problem has no known analytical solution, we often still know of certain properties that the solution should have or we have constraints on the solution and we can test that these properties and constraints are satisfied (e.g., when solving the Newtonian equation of motion for a conservative, time-independent force, we know that the energy associated with the solution is conserved). As with documentation before, it is difficult to write *too many tests* and as long as they run in a reasonable amount of time, erring on the side of testing your code too much is better than not testing it enough!"

For example, the simplest function in ``exampy`` is ``exampy.square`` and we check that this function returns the square by checking a few known solutions. This is done in the following function that we add to ``tests/test_basic_math.py``\n",

    "As you can see, I add a total of three ``assert`` statements that check the behavior of the square function against the known square of the numbers one, two, and three (which I worked out analytically for you ...). Python ``assert`` statements have a very simple behavior: in the case of ``assert True, msg``, nothing happens and the statement following this is executed; in case of ``assert False, msg``, an ``AssertionError`` is raised and the ``msg`` string is printed, and ``msg`` should therefore contain a useful message explaining what went wrong. Therefore, I have written the test of the square function as an ``assert`` that the result from the square function agrees with the known value to a known absolute tolerance (using the ``math.fabs`` function). I have chosen to include the two ``import`` statements to make this test a fully self-contained code example, but when this test file grows, you may want to move these to the top level of the file, such that they do not need to be repeated in each test (however, repeating them makes all of the tests self-contained code snippets, which may be useful when developing and testing the tests).\n",
