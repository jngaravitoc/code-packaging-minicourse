    "# Automatically building and testing your code: continuous integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a test suite for your Python package (even if it is not complete yet), you will want to run it often to check that all tests continue to pass as your package evolves. Doing this automatically is the domain of *continuous integration* and for scientific projects it is most easily done using the free, online services that I discuss in this chapter. Like complete documentation and a comprehensive test suite before, continuous integration is an essential component of a software package that is used by more than a few people and/or receives contributions from outside users (e.g., through pull requests). Setting up continuous integration for your software package will end up saving you lots of time by finding issues with your code quickly and making it less likely that you merge a change that has unexpected, bad consequences."

    "## Why continuous integration?\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of integration all changes into the \"main\" copy of a code base (here, a Python package) on a frequent basis (\"continuously\"). The \"main\" copy in our case is the GitHub repository of the package, that is the bassis of all clones and forks of the code (I assume throughout these notes that the only way the development version of the code is shared is through the GitHub site, even for versions used by the same developer). The main reason to perform continuous integration is to catch any unmergeable changes to the code made in different copies of the code quickly when they can typically be more easily resolved. Continuous integration checks both that the package builds successfully and that it passes the tests in the test suite and this is considered to be a successful integration. \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform continuous integration efficiently, both the build and test system need to be *automated*, that is, they should be able to be run without any human intervention. We have seen how to build a test suite that can be run with a simple ``pytest`` command in the [previous chapter](05-Tests.ipynb); I will discuss how to automate the build with specific examples below. Automating the building and testing of the code is important for taking any human decisions and mistakes out of the loop and for being able to perform the continuous-integration procedure *very often*.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we in practice mean by \"continuous\", because obviously we aren't running the build-and-test procedure all the time? Continuous qualitatively means that we run the build-and-test procedure every time the code or any of its dependencies change. In practice, it is easier to know when one's own code changes than when the code's dependencies change and we typically run the continuous-integration procedure upon every push of changes to GitHub. That is, we can make multiple commits and run the integration tests each time we push a set of commits to GitHub. Ideally, we would run the integration tests in conjunction with each commit, but since integration tests can be expensive and long-to-run, a compromise of running whenever we think the code is ready for a push to GitHub is good and it is easy to setup with automation services. This does mean that one should push changes to GitHub often, typically at least once a day, to make sure that the continuous integration procedure is run often. The code will also change in response to patches or new features submitted through a pull request and it is good practice to run the continuous-integration procedure *before* merging changes from a pull request. It is easy to set this up to be done automatically and, indeed, having continuous integration set up is essential to being able to merge pull requests for your package, because otherwise it is difficult to know that the proposed changes do not break some unexpected part of your code. One typically runs the continuous-integration procedure for changes to any branch, not just ``master``.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way your code runs also changes when its dependencies change. While one could in principle set up a \"continuous\" check for whether dependencies have changed, in practice this is easiest to spot by running the continuous integration procedure on a fixed schedule in addition to any runs in response to pushes or merged pull requests. That way, you can ensure that the integration tests are run even when the code is going through a stretch of minor development. These fixed-schedule tests could be run daily or weekly, depending on how often you think dependencies might change and/or how quickly you think you need to catch this. One way in which the automated build-and-test of your code is useful is that it shows that there is a working version of your code and how to get it to work, which you can point people to who have issues with installing and running your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of continuous integration are many: you will find issues quickly, keep your development version in a working state and, thus, always have a fully-functional version of your code during development (that is, not just at releases), and by making use of automated tools running your integration tests on different types of machines you are able to easily make sure that your code runs on all systems that you support, not just your own. But there are disadvantages as well, the main one being that setting up and maintaining the continuous-integration system takes quite a bit of time and quite often issues that pop up during the integration procedure are due to the way the build-and-test procedure is set up (which can be quite complex for a larger Python package), rather than being due to a real bug in the package itself. For example, the way you install dependencies in the integration step might break and you then have to fix that to keep the continuous-integration procedure working, even though there is likely nothing wrong with your code. Overall, I think even this type of time is well spent, because it is important to know at all times that your code can be built (including its dependencies).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are *many* services available to perform continuous integration of code, because continuous integration is a crucial aspect of all software and software-backed services, allowing bug fixes and updates to be rolled out quickly and often. Continuous integration of course goes far beyond Python packages and is used in the entire range of software, apps, and online services, where it is often combined with *continuous deployment* (CD, leading to the abbreviation CI/CD), the practice of rolling out bug fixes and updates as soon as they are made and pass the integration tests. The most popular CI/CD services are ``Travis CI``, ``Circle CI``, ``Jenkins``, ``appveyor``, and since recently ``GitHub Actions``. I will only discuss ``Travis CI``, ``appveyor``, and ``GitHub Actions`` below, but to a large degree they all work in the same way."
